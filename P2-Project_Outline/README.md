# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The intent of my project is to build the base of a growing restaurant tracking app to aid in selecting a place to eat.  My goals for this phase are to provide the ability to create unique users, for those users to add/subtract restaurants, modify a set list of qualities about those restaurants.  From this users will be able to receive a random recommendation from their list filtered by qualities.

The benefit of this to the user is the ability to easily track restaurants they are interested in or here about, quickly access that information and most importantly creating a way to effortlessly select among them.  This is measurably different then services like Yelp or the RFT Restaurant Guide because it isn’t subject to outside data pollution, limited to venues where you already have interest and the ability of the app to form decisions instead of just assisting them.

### Features
As stated above my limited goals for MVP are:
- Ability to create unique users
- Users have the ability to add/subtract restaurants
- Set and change a set list of qualities for those restaurants

My stretch goal features are:
- Generate a list of places to eat filtered by qualities
- Generate a single suggestion of where to eat filtered qualities

Future versions should provide:
The ability to add user defined qualities
The ability to create and save lists generated from filters 
The ability to scrape from common public data (Google maps/Yelp/etc) to find information such as if the location is open
Suggesting changes to control qualities to the user based on scrape function
Ability to fast add from ‘Search’ based on the scrape function

### Technologies
Java
HTML
CSS
Spring Boot
MongoDB
Hibernate
Thymeleaf templates


### What I'll Have to Learn
Initially how to do all the stuff they just had a copy and paste in LaunchCode 101; then never revisited or covered.

Later how to build my scraper and manage a growing and dynamic database structure.
